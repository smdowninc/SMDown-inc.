  He is in charge of overseeing all management support activities to effectively acquire, manage, and utilize technology among corporate activities. Technology management is usually used separately from production management or marketing among management activities such as research, development, and product development. Technology management operates independently of purchasing, accounting, and labor-management relations, and is evaluated as improving core competencies.
  The CEO of a company is called the CEO, while the CEO of a company is called the CTO. In many U.S. companies, financing was a key corporate activity in the financial market, and it was customary for CFOs to become CEOs.
  In Japanese companies that competed for product differentiation in the market, most technical managers often become CEOs. In Korea, the main source of corporate funds was the government's policy funds, so it has been operated mainly by people with management rights of companies, and technology management was only a management support activity.
  Two major changes in the 21st century are financial reform and market opening. Through financial reform, companies have raised funds directly from the market, and in an open market, it is difficult to gain a competitive advantage without the company's own technology. In a free market without policy protection for specific companies, companies must establish their own core competitiveness for competition. Therefore, corporate management is centered on technology management that builds core competencies. Acquisition, management, and utilization of efficient technologies become the competitive advantage of companies.
